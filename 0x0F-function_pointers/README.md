C - Function pointers.
In C programming language, function pointers are variables that hold the memory address of a function. They can be used to call a function indirectly through the pointer variable, which can be useful in various scenarios.

Function pointers can be useful in situations where we want to pass a function as an argument to another function or return a function from a function. For example:

int apply_operation(int (*operation)(int, int), int a, int b) {
    return operation(a, b);
}

int add_numbers(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int multiply_numbers(int a, int b) {
    return a * b;
}

int main() {
    int result = apply_operation(add_numbers, 10, 20);
    printf("%d\n", result); // Output: 30

    result = apply_operation(multiply_numbers, 10, 20);
    printf("%d\n", result); // Output: 200

    return 0;
}


n the example above, the apply_operation function takes a function pointer operation as an argument and applies it to the arguments a and b. We can pass different functions (add_numbers and multiply_numbers) as the operation argument and get different result
